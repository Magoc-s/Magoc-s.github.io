This is a template repo for creating webpages using the new Jekyll ANU theme. You may fork it/copy it into your own webpage repo and adapt to your needs. This template repo is sort of like the 'Course In a Box' repo that existed for an older version of the theme. You may use it for any type of page, including but not limited to:
 - Course Pages, e.g.
    * [COMP2300](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2300/)
 - Group Pages, e.g.
    * [The c/c/c studio](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/)
 - And broader, e.g.
    * [School of Cybernetics page](https://cybernetics.anu.edu.au/)

The aim of this template is to ease the transition process as much as possible, with the ideal process being as follows:

Copy/Fork this template, modify the structure and page names to fit your needs, then copy over the content from your old page (or create it fresh if it does not exist), adapting to any new requirements or formatting that the new theme permits.

If you require any advanced functionality, such as additional features, more formatting options, or a slightly different look, this can be done through a few different ways, the easiest one being through the '_includes' folder (you can explore the `_includes` folder in this repo if you want to see concrete examples), which allows you to bring in `html` documents, or override existing ones in the theme. This will be explained in further detail later in this document, and in the wiki.
