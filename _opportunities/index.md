## Work with us

Are you looking to make founding contributions to the Australian National University in our work towards honouring Indigenous knowledge in the field of Engineering? 

The ANU will soon be seeking to appoint First Nations leaders whose expertise lies in Indigenous knowledge systems. The appointee will help shape the new Indigenous Engineering Design Studio to effect high impact independent and interdisciplinary collaborations, research and education in engineering. 


Please email with any questions that you might have bandalangstudio@anu.edu.au
