For help in regards to the new Jekyll ANU web theme, please contact the support teams group via:
 - **Email:** [admin.comp.cecs@anu.edu.au](mailto:{{site.jekyll-support-email}}).
 - **Teams:** [CECS Jekyll web support]({{site.jekyll-support-link}}).

These links pull their values from the '_config.yml' file in the root repository of the page repo. To change where the 'Email' link points to, for example, you would simply need to change the value for the 'jekyll-support-email' key in the '_config.yml' file.
