The IEDS is a First Nations-led studio within the School of Engineering which seeks to embed Indigenous knowledge and perspectives into the learnings of a new generation of engineers at the Australian National University.

What are our capabilities as engineers? This question defines a new era of engineering, where understanding multidisciplinary systems and end-of-life responsibilities require new ways of thinking.

The IEDS is a place to help shape these conversations, support First Nations research, forge lasting relationships and drive change towards a more sustainable and equitable future.
