The IEDS started as an intention: something to honour Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander knowledge and its continuing role in innovation, design, research and teaching. Something to be designed, established, and maintained using principles of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander ways of knowing, being and doing.

An Indigenous-led organisation, PwC Indigenous Consulting, have helped us look at how to bring the IEDS into being. Their report emphasised self-determination and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leadership, balanced with sustainability for the initiative, as key to success. 

The report included a range of ideas about the formation of the IEDS, its services and audiences - and now the question is what to do with those ideas. Which ideas should stay, and how should they be implemented. 

Our starting questions are around the vision and purpose of the IEDS, its name (IEDS was only intended to be temporary), how it should look and feel, and what it should do...

We have a space (in the award winning renovated Birch Building) and a person who is here to support the IEDS (a Studio Manager - stay tuned for details about this amazing person!).
