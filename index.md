## Honouring Indigenous knowledge and the role it continues to place in innovation, design, research and teaching

{:.lead}

“[If possible, quote/s about IEDS - as the IEDS is intended to privilege Indigenous voices, will it be possible to include a quote from a First Nations campus person/leader? If not, it may be preferable to leave out the quote.]”

What kind of space can we co-create that:
 - honours Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander knowledge and its continuing role in innovation, design, research and teaching, 
 - is rooted in, and imbued with, principles of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander ways of knowing, being and doing,
 - privileges Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voices, interests and needs.


## Some early thinking...

Indigenous-led organisation recommends where to head

“Right from the beginning, the Indigenous Engineering Design Studio was intended to ***honour Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander knowledge*** and its continuing role in innovation, design, research and teaching. To gain insight into how this might come into being, early research, design and testing was done by an Indigenous-led organisation, PwC Indigenous Consulting (PIC). 

PIC has recommended co-creating the IEDS through three phases of work: ***Establish***, ***Build***, and ***Grow***. 

Overall the report emphasises the principles of self-determination and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leadership, balanced with sustainability for the initiative.

### [Establish](#)

Focuses on setting the IEDS up for success and making critical decisions at the start that will lay the foundation for the path forward. These include decisions around governance, vision and purpose, naming and branding and early testing of ideas for how the space will work.  
Stay tuned here as we’re hoping to co-create and shape these - especially, first up, the vision and purpose, and naming and branding (bye bye temporary name ‘IEDS’!)!

### [Build](#)

All about co-creating, testing and delivering initial offerings of the IEDS and building up the IEDS as an organisation. These include building out the physical space for the IEDS, developing strong partnerships and services and events such as tutoring/mentoring, guest speakers/residencies, industry projects/hackathons

### [Grow](#)

Recommends actions to support the aspiration that the impact of IEDS reaches beyond the ANU ecosystem, and is seen as a leader in the space. This could include programs that share knowledge with a wider audience eg short courses, pre-tertiary holiday programs, online options.

IEDS Residencies

**Excited about what you’ve seen so far? Want to be right at the centre of shaping and co-creating the IEDS? Or just plain curious...!?**

The IEDS is very excited to announce that we will soon open a round of Residencies!!

Our IEDS Residents will be at the forefront of shaping and co-creating with our community… well potentially anything and everything. From the vision and purpose of the IEDS, to what it looks and feels like, what it's called, and what it does.

Residencies will be between 6-12 months, and be open to any person who has a strong interest (and/or expertise) in dSTEM and First Nations peoples and culture. People who identify as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander are especially welcomed.

Applications will open in the final quarter of this year, with Residencies to start in 2023.

Stay tuned, or keep in touch on this via the ‘Connect with Us’ section below.
