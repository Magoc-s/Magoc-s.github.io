This is a template home page for the Jekyll ANU Website Template repo.

## Template Repo Content

This repo contains a selection of sample pages to demonstrate how one may want to use the new Jekyll ANU theme. It is likely you will have to add to and modify this template to suit your website. One way to customise your page is through `_includes` which allow you to import additional `html` documents into your webpage, and then access them through an 'include tag'.

{% include sample-include.html %}
