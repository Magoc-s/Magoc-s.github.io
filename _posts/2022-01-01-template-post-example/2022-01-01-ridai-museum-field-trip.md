Hey class, on the first of January 2022 we're going on a (virtual) field trip to
the [Ridai Museum of Modern
Science](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/places/living-in-japan/attractions-living-in-japan/tokyo-area/iidabashi-area/ridai-museum-of-modern-science/)
in Tokyo.

The details are:

- **time**: 8am AEDT
- **location**: Zoom link (TODO)

## Deliverables

As part of the field trip, you need to write a blog post discussing an
"alternate history" of how the history of computing might have turned out.
