Welcoming all to come for a yarn, learn about the IEDS journey so far, and start co-creating with us what the Indigenous Engineering Design Studio (IEDS) could be and do.

Right from the beginning, the IEDS was intended to ***honour Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander knowledge*** and its continuing role in innovation, design, research and teaching.

Indigenous-led organisation, PwC Indigenous Consulting (PIC) helped us shape how this might come into being through early research, design and testing. 


For more on the PIC report, see [here.]({% link index.md %}#some-early-thinking)

We’re starting work on the first stage of PIC’s recommendations - the _Establish_ phase, which focuses on starting the co-creation of the IEDS. Co-creation of everything from our vision and purpose, to what we’re called (bye bye to our temporary name IEDS!), how we look and feel, and what services we provide. 

To start the conversation ***now***, you can contact us through our form [here.]({% link index.md %}#connect-with-us)

And to continue the conversation, we hope that you’ll join us for our first in-person event - we are just working out a date, time and location. We expect it to be early in Semester 2 in around Week 2 or 3. Stay tuned here for updates, or get news first by signing up to our email list [here.]({% link index.md %}#connect-with-us)
