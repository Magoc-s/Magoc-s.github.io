The soon-to-be-renamed IEDS has found a home in the awarding winning renovated Birch Building on campus. 

The renovated Birch Building received multiple awards in this year’s 2022 ACT Architecture Awards - the renovation has been one that “celebrates its past and transforms it”.

It’s a fitting home for the IEDS which aims to honour the important and historic role of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander knowledges and the role it continues to play within innovation, design, research, and teaching. 

The new space has been set aside for the IEDS - it’s a blank slate, big, open and ready to be co-created with you, our community. Some of the things we’re wondering about include:
- How should the IEDS look and feel?
- How might the IEDS be renamed to reflect this?
- What would you like to do in the (renamed) IEDS?

If you have particular thoughts on these or any other aspects of the IEDS, or are interested in learning more, please contact us [here.]({% link index.md %}#connect-with-us). We would love to hear from you!
