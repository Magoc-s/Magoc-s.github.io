The IEDS has found a home in the awarding winning renovated Birch Building on campus. 

The renovated Birch Building received multiple awards in this year’s 2022 ACT Architecture Awards - the renovation has been one that “celebrates its past and transforms it”.

It’s a fitting home for the IEDS which aims to honour the important and historic role of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander knowledges and the role it continues to play within innovation, design, research, and teaching.
