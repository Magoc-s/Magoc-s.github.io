### The Bundalang Studio has found a home in the awarding winning renovated Birch Building on campus. 

The renovated Birch Building received multiple awards in this year’s 2022 ACT Architecture Awards - the renovation has been one that “celebrates its past and transforms it”.

The Bundalang Studio aims to honour the important and historic role of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander knowledges in innovation, design, research, and teaching.
